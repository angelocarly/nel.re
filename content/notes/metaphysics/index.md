Everything is math.
Everything is art.
Everything is conscious.
Everything is everything.

Not being is limiting. There is always a way to be something.  
And that is fearful. Definition blurs when something is everything.  
Complification leads to confusion and anxiety.  

Yet in all that confusion I see math, art and consciousness.
