- Everything is math.
- Everything is art.
- Everything is conscious.
- Everything is everything.

Not being is limiting. There is *always* some way to be something.  
And that is fearful. Definition blurs when something is everything.  
Blurry definitions make communicating them difficult, they become very abstract.  
Complexity leads to confusion and anxiety.  

Yet in all that confusion I see math, art and consciousness.
