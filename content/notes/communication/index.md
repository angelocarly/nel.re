I want to improve my communication skills.

What is communication?  
Well..

You can *communicate* by talking.  
You can *communicate* by touch.  
You can *communicate* by looking.  
You can *communicate* by not communicating.  
You can *communicate* by **any method**

You can *communicate* with others.  
You can *communicate* to yourself.  
You can *communicate* to the void.  
You can *communicate* to **anything**.  

You can *communicate* rationally.  
You can *communicate* logically.  
You can *communicate* emotionally.  
You can *communicate* in **any structure**.  

Yeah! Let's make this stuff complicated!  
But, I know I'll get lost in overcomplication.  

So I asked my friend.  
She says: "*Sharing and being open to what the other person says. People are good communicators because they listen, are interested and also share what they're interested in.*"

I get anxious sharing my interests.. To improve in communicating doesn't necessarily
So, what are you interested in, and what am I interested in?

To be continued..
