I want to improve my communication skills.

What is communication?  
Well..

You can *communicate* by talking.  
You can *communicate* by touch.  
You can *communicate* by looking.  
You can *communicate* by not communicating.  
You can *communicate* by **any method**

You can *communicate* with others.  
You can *communicate* to yourself.  
You can *communicate* to the void.  
You can *communicate* to **anything**.  

You can *communicate* rationally.  
You can *communicate* logically.  
You can *communicate* emotionally.  
You can *communicate* in **any structure**.  

Yeah! Let's make this stuff complicated!  
I could communicate to a chatbot, or interpret alien signals and send them back without fully understanding them yet. Or I could talk to a person at a cafe, bringing me back to the world. How do you share your ideas with them?

What makes good conversation?

I asked my friend.  
She says: "*Sharing and being open to what the other person says. People are good communicators because they listen, are interested and also share what they're interested in.*"

I get anxious sharing my interests..  
So, what are you interested in, and what am I interested in?

To be continued..
