You can *communicate* by **talking**.  
You can *communicate* by **touch**.  
You can *communicate* by **looking**.  
You can *communicate* by **doing nothing**

You can *communicate* with **others**.  
You can *communicate* to **yourself**.  
You can *communicate* to the **void**.

I can't seem to get a grip over what I'm *communicating* to **others**.  
Oftentimes I *communicate* fear and uncomfort. Not with words, but by actually feeling like that. The body just shows how you feel. Closed arms, nervous scratching, fiddling, inspecting other people, being *tight*.

I'm starting to think it's quite hard to *communicate* casually when you're **feeling** intensely at the same time. I'm pretty emotionally intense, so it can drag me off and block me out of other people easily.

Yet I love understanding people and *want* to communicate with them, and I'm sure I'll find my own way to do so.

To be continued..
