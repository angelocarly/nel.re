Hello, I'm Nellie, welcome to my home.

Here you'll find dreams of pocket dimensions, alternate universes, abstractions, art and more.

Feel free to look around.

About me,

I love thinking, connecting, learning, trying really really hard, difficult things, discovering things, math, music, nature, sports, brains, emotions, turtles, frogs, yellow, art, logic, 'cores' even though I haven't defined them yet, higher dimensions. Something about all those fascinate me, I don't know why. Feel free to join this adventure with me.
