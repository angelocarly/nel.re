# Hiya, I'm Nellie/Lauda! (they/she)
  
Here you'll find dreams of pocket dimensions, alternate universes, abstractions, art and more.

## About me

I love thinking, connecting, learning, difficult things, discovering things, math, music, nature, sports, brains, emotions, turtles, frogs, yellow, art, logic, 'cores' even though I haven't defined them yet, higher dimensions. Something about all those fascinate me, I don't know why. Feel free to join this adventure with me.

I create algorithmic art, drawings and experiments in [art](./art).  
Streams of consciousness in [blog](./blog).  
Projects extending in code in [projects](./projects).

## Links
Feel free to add me anywhere, I'd love to see your stuff!
