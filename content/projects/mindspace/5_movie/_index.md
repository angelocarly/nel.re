The first rendered connections
{{< video src="first_rotation" >}}

A more complex random graph
{{< video src="complext_graph" >}}

Camera controls, perspective transformations and selections
{{< video src="perspective_select" >}}

Labels showing node info
{{< video src="labels" >}}

Here I added more graph modification options and end up playing with cool shapes
{{< video src="shapes" >}}

The current state of mindspace is: 
- A working database connection
- A working graph renderer
- Graph tools
  - Displaying labels
  - Selecting nodes, not edges. (Edges are currently specified by selecting two nodes)
  - Creating/removing nodes
  - Creating/removing edges
  - Physics settings
- No direct link between database and the shown graph
- Selection is buggy

I believe a next good step is trying to integrate the database further and slowly get some fun ways going go manipulate the data.

See you later!
