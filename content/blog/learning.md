Appearantly I'm a bit slower to spot things than other people. I do not know how much of that's true.

I feel like people immediately get projected a clear image into their heads when they're talking to eachother. Whereas I don't understand most things being said to me.

Whether that is a missing skill, a different flavor of brain, I'm not sure. It is quite confusing.
