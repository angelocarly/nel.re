I am.

I am my thoughts.

I am how I treat others.

I shape my name, and my name shapes me.

I shape creations, and my creations shape me.

How I wish every interaction was the true me.

And now I feel.

## Turning feelings into words.

That's what art is.  
Refinement, procedure.

Channeling big tectonical plates of tension, into smaller and smaller pieces. So that more may flow.

I like that thought.

It's hard to form words for feelings, it's a skill. It's like digesting. You're processing something. It feels good.
