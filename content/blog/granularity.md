  - Linking high-level and low-level concepts might be helpful.
    - It's easy to get lost writing highly specialized, complex, low-level code.
    - It's easy to write a high-level document disregarding the complexity of implementing it.
    - It would be nice to have a connected network bridging the high-level and low-level information.
