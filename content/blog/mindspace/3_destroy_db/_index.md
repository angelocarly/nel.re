It's easy to delete your entire database using the graph language syntax.

Luckily I documented all my entries here!

I just updated my [mindspace repo](https://github.com/angelocarly/mindspace) to setup a connection to the graph database. It now prints all existing concepts.

```
cargo run
["Paradox", "Liminality", "CÃ©", "Entropy", "Core"]
```

I've been finding `cypher-shell` hard to work with manually. It's a lot of effort to add simple entries, and even more effort to alter existing ones.

My current focus will be to create a fun way to render the nodes using [cen](https://github.com/angelocarly/cen). That should be a challenge.

To be continued..
