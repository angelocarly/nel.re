I've been working on getting more nodes!

I went through a few algorithms.
- [Barnes-Hut approximation](https://jheer.github.io/barnes-hut/)
- GPU NxN comparison
- GPU grid cells

NxN on GPU turned out to have the cleanest results!

Implementing GPU grid cells also created some fun artifacts ^^

The following is what I'm currently most proud of. It is a snowflake-like graph!

Some highly-complex graph

More crystals ^^

I'm a bit at a loss what to do next.. Maybe extract the graph rendering component to be easily used in the knowledge base? I've also been adding more loose nodes in a journalling context based on feedback from a friend! Life has gotten a bit more in focus, and whilst I love working on graphs and renderers, I'm not sure where my focus lies for now.

See you next time!
