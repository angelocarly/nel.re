What is functional programming?

## Imperative languages

Two concepts:
- **Imperative** `->` An order, imposing a will, something absolutely necessary.
- **Procedural** `->` A series of steps, a sequence of instructions

## Functional languages

- **Expression** `->` Making known one's thoughts or feelings.

### Property 1

A functional language is **not** a concatenation of *commands*, it **is** a composition of **functions**:

- value -> value
- The same input always results in the same output
- A procedure can be a function

### Property 2

Anonymous functions.

**Anonymous** -> Lacking a name.

`(parameters) -> f(parameters)`
